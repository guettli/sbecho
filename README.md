# Second Brain Echo

I am looking for a tool to create, search and edit text snippets.

There are already thousand tools available, but up to now I have not found the right one.

# Required features

* I want to do [self-hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services))
* full text search
* Support for HTML.
* Questions and answers: Like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) I want to use text snippets for learning.
* Work offline.
* Tagging
* Diary. The creation time should automatically get added, so that you can use this tool for writing a diary.

# Maybe required features

* todo/checklist.
* Version control: history of changes of a snippet.

The tool should be easily available:

* via the command-line
* via vscode
* via [Android GBoard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin)
* via the Linux desktop

# Not required

I intend to only use my personal snippets. I don't want to import data from other people.

Although a way to share notes would be nice, for people who want to do that.


# Existing Tools (for learning)

## Learning: Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

There are several open source tools around it: [topic "Anki" at Github](https://github.com/topics/anki)

Good:
* Learning: You have a text for the front-side and the back-side.

Drawback: 

* The fulltext search in the web version is almost unusable. You can't searc in all cards at once, you need to select a category first.
* No way to get snippets into the Android GBoard.

# Existing Tools (for snippets)

## Snippets: Navi

[Navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi) An interactive cheatsheet tool for the command-line.

Good:
* Fast access to snippets from the command-line.

Drawback: 

* The fulltext search in the web version is almost unusable. You can't searc in all cards at once, you need to select a category first.
* No way to get snippets into the Android GBoard.
